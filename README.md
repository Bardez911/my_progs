# My Java Programs

These are some of the java programs that I wrote with my own understanding and logic. These are problems questions on Hacker rank site. 

The Algorithms is the folder holding HackerRank programs while Java holds some java logics that I needed for these programs. The other folder is for any random programs that I made.

Thanks
